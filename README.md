# atmodeller
A Python package for computing the partitioning of volatiles between a planetary atmosphere and its interior.

See [this setup guide](https://gist.github.com/djbower/c66474000029730ac9f8b73b96071db3) for setting up your system to develop *pySPIDER*. If you are a Windows or Linux user (or use a different IDE such as Spyder), please send me your installation instructions so I can update this README. Formally you don't have to use VSCode or Poetry, but using them makes it easier to develop *atmodeller* as a community.

See the Jupyter notebook tutorials in the package directory `docs/`.

## Installation

### General / MacOS (VSCode)

See [this setup guide](https://gist.github.com/djbower/c66474000029730ac9f8b73b96071db3) for setting up your system to develop *pySPIDER*.

### Windows PowerShell installation (VSCode or PyCharm)

1. Install Python if you do not already have it. Powershell will open the windows store where python versions are free for download and install by typing:
   
    ```
    python
    ```
1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) if you do not already have it, preferentially using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/).
1. Clone this repository (*atmodeller*) to a local directory
1. Create a poetry environment in your IDE of choice
   - In VSCode, go to *File* and *Open Folder...* and select the *atmodeller* directory
   - In PyCharm, add a new project and select the *atmodeller* directory
1. We want to set up a virtual Python environment in the root directory of *atmodeller*. An advantage of using a virtual environment is that it remains completely isolated from any other Python environments on your system (e.g. Conda or otherwise). You must have a Python interpreter available to build the virtual environment according to the dependency in `pyproject.toml`, which could be a native version on your machine or a version from a Conda environment that is currently active. You only need a Python binary, so it is not required to install any packages. 
2. Create a virtual environment by using the terminal (you can also use the terminal in your IDE of preference). This command will create a local Python environment in the `.venv` directory:
    
    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
3. Add virtual Python environment as interpreter in your IDE.
   - Open a new terminal window in VSCode and VSCode should recognise that you have a virtual environment in .venv and load this environment automatically. 
   - PyCharm should recognize the virtual environment and the poetry `pyproject.toml` file and propose the installation. If not, manually set up a _Poetry Environment_ under _Add New Interpreter > Add Local Interpreter_. Obtain the installation path of poetry in PowerShell with:

      ```
      gcm poetry
      ```
   You should now see `(.venv)` as the prefix in the terminal prompt.
8. Install the project using poetry to install all the required Python package dependencies:

    ```
    poetry install
    ```

#### Determine path to Jupyter Notebooks
1. To locate the example Jupyter notebooks, enter python:
 
    ```
    python
    ````
2. Once in python type:
 
    ```
    import SpuBase
    SpuBase.__file__
    ```
This will report the location of the *atmodeller* package on your system, from which you can determine the path to *atmodeller/docs*. This directory contains the Jupyter notebook tutorials, which you can copy to a different location if you wish. Then, exit the Python command line using `exit()`.
 
 
#### Running Jupyter Notebooks
1. When located within the *atmodeller* location, you can access the Jupyter notebook tutorials with:
    ```
    jupyter notebook /docs/<FILENAME>.ipynb
    ```
    with `<Filename>` being `1_basics` for example.
   * An alternative to changing directories is to give the absolute path to the notebook you want to open instead.
 
2. In the Jupyter notebook window you may have to *trust* the notebook for all features to work.



### Tarball

If you prefer, I can send you a package tarball that you can install using the terminal. In the long-term I will set up a package repository, but this serves as an intermediate solution. The following instructions are for a Mac with Conda installed, although the instructions are (presumably) similar for a Windows or Linux system.

1. If you have conda installed you can create a new environment *atmodeller*. You can choose any version of python equal to or greater than 3.10:
	
    ```
    conda create --name atmodeller python=3.10
    ```
2. Activate the environment:

    ```
    conda activate atmodeller
    ```
3. Install the *atmodeller* package into the conda environment, where the filename will be something like *atmodeller-0.1.0.tar.gz*:

    ```
    pip install atmodeller-0.1.0.tar.gz
    ````
4. To locate the example Jupyter notebooks, enter python:

    ```
    python
    ````
5. Once in python type: 

    ```
    import atmodeller
    atmodeller.__file__
    ```
This will report the location of the *atmodeller* package on your system, from which you can determine the path to *atmodeller/docs*. This directory contains the Jupyter notebook tutorials, which you can copy to a different location if you wish.

6. With the *docs* location known, you can now access the Jupyter notebook tutorials. Exit the Python command line first, and then in the terminal type:

    ```
    jupyter notebook docs/1_basics.ipynb
    ```
where the path name is updated according to where *docs* is on your system and the notebook you want to open.

7. In the Jupyter notebook window you may have to *trust* the notebook for all features to work.

## Tests

You can confirm that all tests pass by running `pytest` in the root directory. Please add more tests if you add new features.

## Troubleshooting

At its core, *atmodeller* assembles and solves a system of non-linear equations and is therefore subject to the same considerations when solving any system of non-linear equations. *atmodeller* uses `scipy.optimize.root` to select and drive the behaviour of the solver. Arguments can be passed to this function by specifiying arguments when you call `solve()` on an instance of `InteriorAtmosphereSystem`. The default solver is `hybr`, but you can experiment with other solvers as well as the tolerance parameter `tol`.

The following provides some guidance if you are facing challenges with obtaining a solution to your interior-atmosphere system:

1. Confirm that a solution exists. Although *atmodeller* allows you to build a system of arbitrary user-imposed constraints (pressure, fugacity, mass, etc.) this does not necessarily mean that there is a physical solution to the system. If *atmodeller* cannot find a solution it might simply be because a solution does not exist for your imposed constraints. In this regard, it can help to impose a total pressure constraint to first uncover the general behaviour of the solution before imposing pressure or fugacity constraints on individual species.

1. Confirm that the species chosen for your reaction network are appropriate for the pressure and temperature conditions of interest. We recall that *atmodeller* does not perform any internal tests to determine whether or not the species you have chosen are thermodynamically stable at the specified conditions. Hence prior knowledge, intuition, or calculations with a Gibbs minimiser are required to guide the choice of species. Related, if the dynamic range of the species abundances is too large then you may encounter problems.

1. Numerical overflow can occur when the solver steps to a region of parameter space that causes the pressure to become too large. This is because the reaction network component of the non-linear system is formulated in terms of log10(pressure), but the actual pressure is required for mass balance and hence 10**log10(pressure) is computed. In this regard, reducing the `factor` parameter can prevent the solver from stepping too far [(read more)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.root-hybr.html).

1. Simplify your system by systematically removing species and/or removing non-linear dependences. For example, oxygen fugacity buffers, real gas equations of state, and solubility relations can depend on the total pressure, which adds an additional pressure coupling between the system of equations compared to simpler ideal-gas only systems. Swapping mass constraints for pressure constraints can also help, as long as the pressure constraints are compatible with a solution (see point 1 above). In short, starting with a simple ideal-gas only reaction network and adding incremental complexity is a good approach narrow down reasons why a solution cannot be found.

1. Choose an appropriate initial guess. Providing an initial guess closer to the true solution will improve the chances that the solver can locate and converge to the correct (global) minimum. You can specify the initial guess using the `initial_solution` argument of `solve()` on an instance of `InteriorAtmosphereSystem`. If you are systematically iterating over a set of parameters, you can often use the previous solution to the system as the initial guess for the next system with perturbed parameters.
