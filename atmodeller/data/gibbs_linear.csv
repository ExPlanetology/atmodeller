# Standard Gibbs free energy of formation fitting constants.
# These parameters result from a linear fit in temperature space to the delta-f G column in the
# JANAF data tables for a given molecule.
# G = aT + b
# where a = -S (standard entropy of formation) and b = H (standard enthalpy of formation).
# G has units of kJ/mol.
