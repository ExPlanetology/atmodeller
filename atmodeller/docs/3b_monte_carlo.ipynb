This keeps the RMSE between the initial guess and actual solution to a smaller value than simply guessing a constant initial condition. Also, fit = True allows you to train an initial condition on a similar but not identical model (for example, different solubility laws or gas equations of states), where once enough samples have been generated you would prefer to only use the new model to generate new estimates (since the behavior of the new model and the previous similar-but-not-the-same model will diverge)."
